**Email**: `noushadm.online@gmail.com`
**Based On**: Ahmed Kutty (b35ea557-f1a1-4e3d-b761-7e6b2f3b6c32)
**Key Difference**: JTB 5936 branch RESTRICTED

---

## 📋 NOUSHAD'S PERMISSIONS CONFIGURATION

Noushad has the following restrictions (identical to Ahmed Kutty, except JTB branch):

### 1. **Location/Branch Access** (3 branches - JTB EXCLUDED)
- ✅ Frozen / ثلاجة
- ✅ Nashad - Frozen / ثلاجة
- ✅ Nisam - Frozen / ثلاجة
- ❌ **JTB 5936** - **RESTRICTED** (not accessible to Noushad)

**Effect**: Location filter dropdowns will only show these 3 options. All data queries will be automatically filtered to these branches.

### 2. **Customer Owner Access** (4 owners - SAME as Ahmed Kutty)
- ✅ Nashad (13 customers in database)
- ✅ Nisam (7 customers in database) ⚠️ *Updated: Nisam now has customer data*
- ✅ Frozen Counter (1 customer in database) ⚠️ *Updated: Count changed from 2 to 1*
- ✅ Unassigned (2 customers in database)

**Effect**: Customer owner filter will show these 4 options. All owners now have customer data.

**Total Accessible Customers**: 23 customers (Nashad: 13, Nisam: 7, Frozen Counter: 1, Unassigned: 2)

### 3. **Vehicle Instalment Departments** (1 department - SAME as Ahmed Kutty)
- ✅ Frozen (9 vehicles in database)

**Effect**: Vehicle instalments page will only show the 9 vehicles belonging to the Frozen department. All other departments will be hidden.

### 4. **Loan Filtering Rules** (SAME as Ahmed Kutty)
- ✅ Show overdue loans (past maturity date)
- ✅ Show loans with remaining days < 30

**Effect**: Loans page will only display:
- Loans that are overdue (maturity date has passed)
- OR loans expiring within the next 30 days
- Fully paid loans (status: 'closed') are excluded

### 5. **Other Settings**
- **Preferred Language**: English (en)
- **Display Name**: Noushad (English) / نوشاد (Arabic)
- **Role**: Manager

## 🔍 VERIFICATION QUERIES (For Reference)

These queries were used to verify the migration:

### Verify Noushad's Record
```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  user_email,
  display_name_en,
  display_name_ar,
  array_length(allowed_branches, 1) as branch_count,
  allowed_branches,
  array_length(allowed_customer_owners, 1) as owner_count,
  array_length(vehicle_instalment_departments, 1) as dept_count,
  loan_filter_rules,
  preferred_language,
  role
FROM user_branch_permissions
WHERE user_id = '1d13f625-6bcf-4c6e-aeae-7973bd03d89a';
```

**Expected Output**:
- `user_email`: "noushadm.online@gmail.com"
- `display_name_en`: "Noushad"
- `display_name_ar`: "نوشاد"
- `branch_count`: **3** (not 4!)
- `owner_count`: 4
- `dept_count`: 1
- `loan_filter_rules`: {"show_overdue": true, "remaining_days_threshold": 30}

### Compare Noushad vs Ahmed Kutty
```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN user_id = '1d13f625-6bcf-4c6e-aeae-7973bd03d89a' THEN 'Noushad'
    WHEN user_id = 'b35ea557-f1a1-4e3d-b761-7e6b2f3b6c32' THEN 'Ahmed Kutty'
  END as user_name,
  user_email,
  array_length(allowed_branches, 1) as branch_count,
  allowed_branches,
  array_length(allowed_customer_owners, 1) as owner_count,
  array_length(vehicle_instalment_departments, 1) as dept_count,
  role
FROM user_branch_permissions
WHERE user_id IN (
  '1d13f625-6bcf-4c6e-aeae-7973bd03d89a',  -- Noushad
  'b35ea557-f1a1-4e3d-b761-7e6b2f3b6c32'   -- Ahmed Kutty
)
ORDER BY user_name;
```

**Expected Output**:
| user_name | branch_count | allowed_branches | owner_count | dept_count |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| Ahmed Kutty | 4 | [Frozen, Nashad-Frozen, Nisam-Frozen, **JTB 5936**] | 4 | 1 |
| Noushad | **3** | [Frozen, Nashad-Frozen, Nisam-Frozen] | 4 | 1 |

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

Once migration is executed, test Noushad's account:

### Step 1: Verify Database Record
- [ ] Run verification query above
- [ ] Confirm `branch_count` = 3 (not 4!)
- [ ] Confirm JTB 5936 NOT in `allowed_branches` array

### Step 2: Test Location Filter
1. Log in as Noushad (noushadm.online@gmail.com)
2. Go to any page with location filter (Vendors, Customers, etc.)
3. Open the location dropdown
4. ✅ Should see only 3 branches: Frozen, Nashad-Frozen, Nisam-Frozen
5. ❌ Should NOT see: JTB 5936, Khaleel, Osaimi, or any other branches

### Step 3: Verify JTB Restriction
1. Stay logged in as Noushad
2. Try to access any data from JTB 5936 branch
3. ✅ Should NOT appear in any reports or filters
4. ✅ Location filter should NOT show JTB option

### Step 4: Test Customer Owner Filter
1. Stay logged in as Noushad
2. Go to Customers page
3. Open the "Customer Owner" dropdown
4. ✅ Should see only: All, Nashad, Nisam, Frozen Counter, Unassigned
5. ❌ Should NOT see: Khaleel, Osaimi, or any other sales persons

### Step 5: Test Vehicle Instalments
1. Stay logged in as Noushad
2. Go to Vehicle Instalments page

4. ✅ Should see only: All Departments, Frozen
5. Verify vehicle list shows only Frozen department vehicles (9 vehicles)

### Step 6: Test Loans Filtering

3. ✅ Should only see loans that are:
   - Overdue (status badge shows "Overdue")
   - OR Remaining days < 30

### Step 7: Compare with Ahmed Kutty
1. Log in as Ahmed Kutty (ahammedkuttykoottil1976@gmail.com)
2. Verify Ahmed Kutty CAN see JTB 5936 in location filter
3. Log back in as Noushad
4. Verify Noushad CANNOT see JTB 5936
5. ✅ This confirms the restriction is working

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Noushad sees 4 branches instead of 3
**Cause**: Migration didn't execute or user session not refreshed
**Solution**:
1. Run verification query to check database
2. If database shows 3 branches, have Noushad log out and log back in
3. Clear browser cache/cookies if needed

### Issue: Noushad can still see JTB 5936 data
**Cause**: Frontend caching or permissions not loading
**Solution**:
1. Verify database record shows only 3 branches
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Log out completely and log back in
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Location filter shows no branches
**Cause**: Branch names don't match database exactly
**Solution**: Run this query to verify branch names:
```sql
SELECT location_name FROM branch
WHERE location_name IN (
  'Frozen / ثلاجة',
  'Nashad - Frozen / ثلاجة',
  'Nisam - Frozen / ثلاجة'
);
```
All 3 branches should be returned.

   - Noushad has 3 branches (not 4)
   - JTB 5936 is NOT in allowed_branches array
   - All other permissions match Ahmed Kutty

3. **Test Noushad's account**:
   - Log in as noushadm.online@gmail.com
