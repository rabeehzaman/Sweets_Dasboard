**Email**: `ahammedkuttykoottil1976@gmail.com`
**Status**: ‚úÖ FULLY COMPLETED - Migration Executed Successfully

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

All application code has been successfully updated to support Ahmed Kutty's restricted permissions. The system is now permission-aware and ready to filter data once the database migration is executed.

### 1. SQL Migration File Created
**File**: `migrations/ahmed-kutty-permissions.sql`

This file contains:
- Schema extension (3 new columns added to `user_branch_permissions` table)
- Ahmed Kutty's user record with all permissions configured
- Verification query to confirm successful insertion

### 2. Auth Context Updated
**File**: `src/contexts/auth-context.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Extended `UserPermissions` interface with:
  - `allowedCustomerOwners: string[]`
  - `vehicleInstalmentDepartments: string[]`
  - `loanFilterRules: { show_overdue: boolean, remaining_days_threshold: number } | null`
- Updated `fetchPermissions()` function to retrieve new fields from database
- All new permissions are now loaded on user login

### 3. Location Filter Context Updated
**File**: `src/contexts/location-filter-context.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `useAuth()` hook import
- Implemented permission-based branch filtering (lines 78-81)
- Only shows branches that user has access to
- Auto-refreshes when permissions change
- Admin users bypass filtering (see all branches)

### 4. Customer Owner Hook Updated
**File**: `src/hooks/use-customer-aging-kpis.ts`

**Changes**:
- Updated `useCustomerOwners()` function (lines 352-392)
- Added `useAuth()` hook import
- Filters customer owner options based on `allowedCustomerOwners` permission
- Only displays owners in the allowed list
- Admin users bypass filtering (see all owners)

### 5. Vehicle Department Filter Updated
**File**: `src/hooks/use-vehicle-filters.ts`

**Changes**:
- Updated `useDepartmentOptions()` function (lines 12-53)
- Added `useAuth()` hook import
- Filters department options based on `vehicleInstalmentDepartments` permission
- Ahmed Kutty will only see "Frozen" department
- Admin users bypass filtering (see all departments)

### 6. Loans Hook Updated
**File**: `src/hooks/use-loans.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added `useAuth()` hook import
- Implemented client-side loan filtering (lines 103-119)
- Filters loans based on `loanFilterRules`:
  - Shows overdue loans (`status === 'overdue'`)
  - OR shows loans with remaining days < threshold (30 days)
- Admin users bypass filtering (see all loans)

## ‚úÖ DATABASE MIGRATION - COMPLETED

**Migration Executed**: October 11, 2025
**Method**: Supabase MCP `apply_migration`
**Result**: SUCCESS

### Migration Results:
- ‚úÖ Added 3 new columns to `user_branch_permissions` table:
  - `allowed_customer_owners TEXT[]`
  - `vehicle_instalment_departments TEXT[]`
  - `loan_filter_rules JSONB`
- ‚úÖ Created Ahmed Kutty user record with permissions
- ‚úÖ All 4 branches verified to exist in database
- ‚úÖ 3 out of 4 customer owners verified (see note below)
- ‚úÖ Frozen department verified (9 vehicles available)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note - "Nisam" Customer Owner
**Issue Found**: The customer owner "Nisam" is included in Ahmed Kutty's `allowed_customer_owners` array, but **does NOT exist** in the `customer_balance_aging_filtered` view.

**Actual Customer Owners in Database**:
- ‚úÖ Nashad (13 customers)
- ‚úÖ Frozen Counter (2 customers)
- ‚úÖ Unassigned (2 customers)
- ‚ùå Nisam (0 customers - **DOES NOT EXIST**)
- Khaleel (10 customers - not assigned to Ahmed Kutty)
- Osaimi (38 customers - not assigned to Ahmed Kutty)

**Impact**: When Ahmed Kutty selects "Nisam" from the customer owner filter, no customers will be displayed because no customers are owned by "Nisam" in the database.

**Recommendation**: Either remove "Nisam" from the permissions or wait for "Nisam" customer owner data to be added to the system.

## ‚èπÔ∏è ORIGINAL MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS (NO LONGER NEEDED)

~~You need to execute the SQL migration to activate Ahmed Kutty's permissions.~~

**UPDATE**: Migration has been completed using Supabase MCP. The instructions below are kept for reference only.

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rulbvjqhfyujbhwxdubx
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `migrations/ahmed-kutty-permissions.sql`
5. Click **Run** to execute
6. Verify the output shows Ahmed Kutty's record with correct counts

### Option 2: Using psql Command Line

```bash
# Get your database connection string from Supabase Dashboard
# Settings > Database > Connection String (Session mode recommended)

psql "postgresql://postgres.[ref]:[password]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres" \
  -f migrations/ahmed-kutty-permissions.sql
```

### Option 3: Using Supabase CLI

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g supabase

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref rulbvjqhfyujbhwxdubx

# Apply the migration
supabase db push --local false --include-all
```

  array_length(vehicle_instalment_departments, 1) as dept_count,
  loan_filter_rules,

## üîç VERIFICATION QUERIES

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify data:

### Check User Record
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_branch_permissions
WHERE user_id = 'b35ea557-f1a1-4e3d-b761-7e6b2f3b6c32';
```

### Check All Branches in Database
```sql
SELECT location_name FROM branch
WHERE location_name NOT ILIKE '%wh%'
  AND location_name NOT ILIKE '%van%'
ORDER BY location_name;
```

### Check All Customer Owners
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_owner_name_custom
FROM customer_balance_aging_filtered
WHERE customer_owner_name_custom IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY customer_owner_name_custom;
```

### Check All Vehicle Departments
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM vehicle_loans
ORDER BY department;
```

---

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Location filter shows no branches
**Cause**: Branch names in SQL don't match database
**Solution**: Run this query to get exact branch names:
```sql
SELECT location_name FROM branch ORDER BY location_name;
```
Then update the `allowed_branches` array in the SQL migration to match exactly.

### Issue: Customer owner filter shows "All" only
**Cause**: Customer owner names don't match database
**Solution**: Run this query:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_owner_name_custom
FROM customer_balance_aging_filtered
WHERE customer_owner_name_custom IS NOT NULL;
```
Then update the `allowed_customer_owners` array to match exactly.

### Issue: No vehicles showing up
**Cause**: Department name doesn't match or no vehicles exist
**Solution**: Run this query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM vehicle_loans WHERE department = 'Frozen';
```
Verify vehicles exist and department name matches exactly.

### Issue: All loans are hidden
**Cause**: No loans meet the filter criteria
**Solution**: Run this query:
```sql
-- This query simulates the loan filtering logic
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT
    *,
    CASE
      WHEN /* loan is overdue */ THEN 'overdue'
      WHEN /* remaining days < 30 */ THEN 'expiring_soon'
      ELSE 'hidden'
    END as visibility
  FROM loans
) WHERE visibility IN ('overdue', 'expiring_soon');
```

### Issue: Permissions not loading
**Cause**: User session needs refresh
**Solution**:
1. Log out of the application
2. Clear browser cache/cookies
3. Log back in as Ahmed Kutty
4. Check browser console for errors
